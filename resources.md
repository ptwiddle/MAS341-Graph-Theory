Notes
-----

The primary and update to date notes are the [html version](https://ptwiddle.github.io/Graph-Theory-Notes/MAS341.html) this allows links and interactive elements.  The notes are produced in [PreTeXt](https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/), a markup language which theoretically allows production of both good html pages and pdfs; I'm focusing on the html element and hopefully the pdfs will be okay.

Other Graph Theory textbooks and notes
- [Bondy and Murty's Graph Theory with Applications](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~hahn/IFT3545/GTWA.pdf) includes most of what we do at about the same level, and
not too much more
- The same is true of [Robin J. Wilson's *Introduction to Graph Theory*](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/wilsongraph.pdf)
- [An archive of a previous year's website](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/) the notes there are close to what we'll be doing, but not identical
