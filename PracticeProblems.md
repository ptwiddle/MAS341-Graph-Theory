Commentary
====

- [Week 1:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week1problems.html) Degree for non-simple graphs is more conceptual trying to get you to think carefully about definitions; the others are pretty good.
- [Week 2:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week2problems.html) Not so useful for the exam.  Connected components and counting paths are a bit of a tangent; finding Eulerian paths could come up, but I don't think you'd find it hard.
- [Week 3:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week3problems.html) All mostly pretty solid questions on Hamiltonian cycles, good practice.
- [Week 4:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week4problems.html) Pretty good practice for trees and chemistry applications.
- [Week 5:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week5problems.html) Not really like exam questions.  Counting spanning trees is really just case by case, but would be rare that it comes up.
- [Week 6:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week6problems.html) Fine for Dijkstra practice; ignore the longest path questions.
- [Week 7:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week7problems.html) Good practice showing graphs aren't planar and drawing them on other surfaces, like exam questions.  Replace Real Projective Plane with Mobius band.
- [Week 8:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week8problems.html) Skip "Annoying to draw" (we didn't do Klein Bottle); others are good applications of Euler's theorem.
- [Week 9:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week9problems.html) Good chromatic number and chromatic index questions
- [Week 10:](https://ptwiddle.github.io/MAS341-Graph-Theory-2017/practiceproblems/week10problems.html) Good computing chromatic polynomial questions
