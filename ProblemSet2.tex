All questions use the graph $\Gamma$ shown above.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $\Gamma$ isn't Hamiltonian, using the fact that it's bipartite
\item Find a clsoed walk that uses every vertex but vertex 4 exactly once, and by adapting the Planarity Algorithm for Hamiltonian graphs, prove that $\Gamma$ isn't planar (the argument begins: if it were drawn on the plane, the closed walk you found would be a circle.  Now, vertex 4 must be inside or outside the circle... )
\item Give another proof that $\Gamma$ isn't planar using Kuratowski's theorem
\item Let $e$ be the edge connecting vertices D and 5.  Show that if we remove $e$, the resulting graph $\Gamma\setminus e$ is planar by drawing it on the plane, being sure to label your vertices.
\end{enumerate}
