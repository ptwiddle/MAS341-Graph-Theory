Because of the strike, class will not meet Week 3.

The university's insistence that "disruption will be minimal" and "all missed material will be made up" is disingenous, there frankly isn't enough time.

To mitigate this, I have placed standard material that most students enjoy and find easy for this lectures -- two algorithms for finding minimal weight spanning trees (Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm -- note the second was not covered the last few years), and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the cheapest path between two vertices.  


Please help each other out in learning this material -- many of you will already be familiar with it from decision maths.  There is now discussion of this material in the notes, but rather than try to learn it by reading that, it's probably easier to explore alternative sources on the internet.  In addition to [dozens, if not hundreds of videos](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dijkstra%27s+algorithm&client=ubuntu&hs=TcB&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN4tubgbfZAhVQDewKHX0tCUIQ_AUICigB&biw=1625&bih=671) available explaining these concepts, there are, for instance, sites that [interactively run Dijkstra's algorithm](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Dijkstra.html).  Take quick looks at several different sources; I'd be very curious to see what works for you. There is a lot of value in figuring out how to learn this material on your own -- tracking down good sources for learning online is a skill I use every day.  If you find any sources that you think are particularly great, let me know; I will collate some of these and share them with the class.

You will not be responsible for proving that any of these three algorithms work; only for being able to run them on examples, and analyse what happens if the edge weights change slightly.  I plan for the first lecture back on Week 4 to be a very quick recap of this material, as well as a more in depth discussion of other aspects of trees; after the end of term I will also run several review sessions, and I will devote one to doing a few examples of this material.    

Furthermore, I am making the first of the three bits of coursework conceptual questions about these algorithms, Questions 7 and 16 from the [Exercises section](https://ptwiddle.github.io/Graph-Theory-Notes/s_graphalgorithms_exercises.html) of the algorithms chapter.  You can hand these questions in as early as Friday, week 4, and anytime before the start of Easter break, and I will give you feedback on your solution.
