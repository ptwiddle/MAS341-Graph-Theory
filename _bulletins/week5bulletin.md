Morning: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths
=====

In the morning we discussed Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path between points on a weighted graph.  Dijkstra's algorithm 


Afternoon: Travelling Salesperson problem
=====

We used the following table:

$$\begin{array}{llllll}

A &   &   &   &   &   \\
5 & B &   &   &   &   \\
7 & 8 & C &   &   &   \\
6 & 3 & 8 & D &   &   \\
4 & 7 & 1 & 3 & E &   \\
5 & 4 & 9 & 4 & 7 & F \\
