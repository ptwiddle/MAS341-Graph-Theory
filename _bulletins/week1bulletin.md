[slides](../Slides/Lecture1.html) and afternoon

In the morning, we discussed basic course policies, including the impending doom of the UCU strike, looked at examples and basic definitions of graphs, defined the degree of a vertex, looked at how it came up in chemistry, and proved Euler's handshaking lemma, and then introduced the Instant Insanity puzzle, also known as the four cubes problem.
