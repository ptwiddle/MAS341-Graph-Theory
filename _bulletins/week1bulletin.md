Morning
----
[slides](../Slides/Lecture1.html)

In the morning, we discussed basic course policies, including the impending doom of the UCU strike, looked at examples and basic definitions of graphs, defined the degree of a vertex, looked at how it came up in chemistry, and proved Euler's handshaking lemma, and then introduced the Instant Insanity puzzle, also known as the four cubes problem.

Afternoon
----
[slides](../Slides/Lecture2.html)

In the afternoon, we showed how to solve instant insanity, defined subgraphs, defined isomorphisms of graphs, discussed complexity theory, P vs. NP and the graph isomorphism theorem as bits of mathematical culture, and then gave some practical hints about how to show graphs are or aren't isomorphic.
