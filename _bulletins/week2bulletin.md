Morning

[slides](../Slides/Lecture3.html)

In the morning, we discussed what is usually considered the birth of graph theory, in the bridges of Konigsberg question.  We defined walks on graphs, and what it meant for a graph to be connected.  We proved Euler's theorem that a connected graph has an Eulerian cycle if and only if every vertex has even degree, and the analogous formula for semi-Eulerian graphs.

In the afternoon, we introduced Hamiltonian cycles.  Although the definition is remarkably similar to Eulerian graphs, it turns to out to be very hard (i.e., NP complete) to determine whether or not a graph is Hamiltonian.  That doesn't mean it isn't possible to do for small graphs, though, and we discussed some ways to do this; we used one of these to prove that the Petersen graph is not Hamiltonian.  We proved Ore's theorem that a graph with "enough" edge is Hamiltonian.
