\begin{frame}{Proving a graph \emph{isn't} Hamiltonian is hard}
  \begin{block}{In \emph{theory} it's easy:}
    Only finitely many possible paths; check them all.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{But number of possible paths grows very quickly}
We can't prove there's no easy way to check if a graph is Hamiltonian or not, but we've bet the world economy that there isn't.
  \end{block}
  
\begin{block}{Mathematical culture: NP-completeness}
  Determining whether or not a graph is Hamiltonian is ``NP-complete'' i.e., any problem in NP can be reduced to checking whether or not a certain graph is Hamiltonian. 
\end{block}
If we found an easy algorithm, could break standard encryption.

\begin{frame}{Proving a graph isn't Hamiltonian: case-by-case}
  \begin{theorem}If we remove a vertex from $D_{20}$, it is not longer Hamiltonian.
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{block}{Proof Sketch}

    \begin{itemize}
\item Suppose $D_{20}$ was Hamiltonian
\item At every vertex, exactly two edges used in cycle
\item Suppose certain edge in cycle, chase consequences: \\
  Other edges must be in/out of cycle
\item Iterate 
    \end{itemize}
Useful observations: edges can't make a smaller cycle
    \end{proof}
This strategy will work in general, but may be very complicated.

  \begin{lemma}If $G$ is bipartite and Hamiltonian, then $G$ has the same number of red and blue vertices.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item          The vertices in the Hamiltonian cycle alternate red and blue
        \item The Hamiltonian cycle contains all the vertices
\end{itemize}
      \end{proof}  

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Tool: assume $G$ is Hamiltonian, consider ``extra'' edges}
  \begin{theorem}The Petersen graph $P$ isn't Hamiltonian
  \end{theorem}

  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $P$ is Hamiltonian.  The Hamiltonian cycle uses up two edges at each vertex, so we have one more edge meeting each vertex.

\begin{block}{Analyze how to place these five edges.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Can't go to next vertex in cycle: no multiple edges
    \item Can't ``skip'' one or two: $P$ has no 3 or 4 cycles
    \item So extra edges ``straight across'' $\pm 1$ 
    \item Rule out straight across
    \item Rule out all ``skip 3''
        \end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{proof}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{A sufficient condition to be Hamiltonian}
\begin{block}{If we have ``enough'' edges, should be Hamiltonian}
  If $G$ is Hamiltonian and we add extra edges, the result is still Hamiltonian.
\end{block}

\begin{theorem}[Ore] Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices, so that for any two nonadjacent vertices $v$ and $w$, we have $deg(v)+deg(w)\geq n$.  Then $G$ is Hamiltonian.
\end{theorem}
\alert{Not an ``If and only If!'' -- won't prove $G$ isn't Hamiltonian}
\begin{block}{Proof ingredients}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Minimal Criminal'': minimal/maximal counterexamples have extra structure
    \item ``adding extra edges''
    \item Pigeonhole principal
\end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Proof of Ore's Theorem}
\begin{block}{Minimal criminimal:}
  Assume $G$ is a counterexample, but then adding any edge to $G$ makes it Hamiltonian.  \\ Then $G$ must be semi-Hamiltonian.
\end{block}
  \begin{block}{Adding extra edges}
  Let $v_1-v_2-\dots-v_n$ be the Hamiltonian path.  $v_1$ and $v_2$ not adjacent so $deg(v_1)+deg(v_2)\geq n$.  \\
  So we need to add $n-2$ more edges to $v$ or $w$.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Pigeon hole principle}
  Let $i\in 3,\dots, n-1$ with $v_1$ adjacent to $v_i$ and $v_n$ adjacent to $v_{i-1}$: then we have a Hamiltonian path! \\
  Use pigeon-hole principle to find such an $i$.
  \end{block}
