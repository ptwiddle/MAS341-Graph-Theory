<h1> Graph Theory Lecture 2 </h1>
<h2> Instant Insanity.  Isomorphisms. </h2>

</section>


<section>
<h1> An application </h1>

</section>

<section>
<h2> Instant Insanity </h2>
<ul>
<li> 4 cubes </li>
<li>Each side of each cube is colored one of four colors</li>
<li>Goal is to stack the cubes so each direction has one face of each color</li>
</ul>
<p> Given a set of cubes, you will need to be able to either find a solution or prove that a solution does not exist </p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>These cubes have no solution </h2>

<section>
  <h2>What would a solution look like on the graph?</h2>
  <p>Think first about colors on front/back:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> A set of four edges, one with each label 1-4</li>
    <li> Each colour appears on two different edges </li>
</ul>
<p>Can also see that if we have a set of edges satisfying these properties, we can solve cubes for front and back</p>
</section>


<section>

  <h2>Can restate with subgraphs</h2>

<p>A <b>subgraph</b> $S$ of $\Gamma$ is a graph $S$ where 
<ul> 
<li>$V(S)\subset V(\Gamma)$</li>
<li>$E(S)\subset E(\Gamma)$</li>
</ul>
<p>If an edge $e$ is in $S$, then we need both its ends in $S$.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Back to Instant Insanity</h2>
  <p>So to solve the front and back of the cube, we're looking for a subgraph $FB$ with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> $FB$ contains all four vertices </li>
    <li> Each vertex of $FB$ has degree 2</li>
    <li> Each label 1-4 appears on an edge of $FB$</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Completing Instant Insanity</h2>
  <ul><li>We described how to solve the front and back with a certain subgraph $FB$</li>
    <li>Solving the top and bottom is equivalent to finding another subgraph $TB$ satisfying the same properties.</li>
    <li>To solve the whole cube, we need <b>two</b> subgraphs $FB$ and $TB$ satisfying the requirement, that <b>don't share any edges</b></li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Definition, slightly loose</h3>
<p>An <b>isomorphism</b> of graphs is a bijection between the vertices that preserves the number of edges between pairs of vertices.</p>  
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Definition, more detailed</h3>
<p>An isomorphism from a simple graph $G$ to a graph $H$ is a bijection $$\varphi:V(G)\to V(H)$$ so that, for any $v,w\in V(G)$, the number of edges between $v$ and $w$ (in $G$) is the same as the number of edges between $\varphi(v)$ and $\varphi(w)$ (in $H$).</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>The isomorphism problem:</h2>
<p>Given two graphs $G$ and $H$, either find an isomorphism $\varphi:G\to H$, or prove such an isomorphism doesn't exist.</p>

<p> You need to be be able to answer instances of the isomorphism problem for the exam </p>

</section>

<section>
<h2> A little mathematical culture </h2>

The isomorphism problem is of fundamental importance to theoretical computer science.

<ul>
<li> Practical applications </li>
<li> It's in NP, but not known to be NP complete or in P </li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mathematical culture, continued</h2>
  <h3>P vs NP: complexity theory</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A Yes/No question is in P if it can be solved in time polynomial in the input size</li>
    <li>A Yes/No question is in NP if the answer is Yes, I can give you some information that lets you <i>check</i> that in polynomial time.</li>
    <li>Settling whether or not P=NP is worth a million dollars (at least)</li>
  </ul>
</section>  
    

<section>
  <h2>Mathematical culture, continued</h2>
<p>In November 2015, Laszlo Babai announced a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem. The proof that his algorithm is correct depends on the classification of finite simple groups, a deep result whose proof is several thousand pages long.   His work is still actively being checked; in January 2017 he patched a hole that had been found. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why group theory?</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
  Let $\textrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ be the set of all isomorphisms $\varphi:G\to G$.  Then $G$ is a group.
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Theorem</h3>
  Any finite group $H$ appears is of the form $\text{Aut}(\Gamma)$ for some finite graph $\Gamma$.
  
  <h3>Idea of proof</h3>
  <ul><li>  There's a natural way to build a graph (the <i>Cayley graph</i>) from a group $H$ and a set of generators of $H$.</li>

    <li>$H<\textrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$, and can modify the construction to get equality</li></ul>
  
 </section>


<section>
<h2> How to prove to graphs are isomorphic? </h2>
<p> Write down an isomorphism </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Ok, but how do I <i>find</i> an isomorphism?</h2>
  One useful method -- expanding local isomorphisms.
  <ul>
    <li>An isomorphism $\varphi:G\to H$would have to preserve the degree, so pick one vertex $v$; it could map to any vertex $w\in H$ with $d(v)=d(w)$</li>
    <li>Now, the vertices adjance to $v$ would have to map to the vertices adjacent to $w$; they have to match degrees, etc...</li>
<li>Continue expanding $\varphi$ out from $v$</li>
   </ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>How to prove two graphs <i>aren't</i> isomorphic? </h2>
<p>Could do a case-by-case: expand out as above, and show it's not possible.  Usually better to find an <i>obstruction</i> -- a difference between the two graphs </p>
<ul>
<li> Number of vertices </li>
<li> Number of edges </li>
<li> "connectedness" </li>
<li> "loops"</li>
<li> $\dots$ </li>
</ul>
