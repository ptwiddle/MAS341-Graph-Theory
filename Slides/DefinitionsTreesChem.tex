  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{empty graph} $E_n$ has $n$ vertices and no edges
  \item The \emph{complete graph} $K_n$ has $n$ vertices, and each vertex is connected to every other.
  \item The \emph{path graph} $P_n$ has $n$ vertices $\{1,\dots,n\}$ with an edge between $i$ and $i+1$
    \item The \emph{cycle graph} $C_n$ has $n$ vertices $\{1,\dots, n\}$ with an edge between $i$ and $i+1$ and between $n$ and $1$.

\begin{frame}{Connected means we can ``get from any vertex to another''}
  \begin{definition}[Walk] Let $G$ be a simple graph.  A \emph{walk} in $G$ is a sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ so that $v_i$ is adjacent to $v_{i+1}$.  We we say the walk goes from $v_1$ to $v_n$.
    \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Connected] A graph $G$ is \emph{connected} if there is a walk between any two vertices $v$ and $w$ in $G$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{block}{Definitions I won't use without explaining:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A \emph{trail} is a walk that doesn't repeat any edges
    \item A \emph{path} is a walk that doesn't repeat any vertices
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\end{frame}
  
\begin{frame}{Bipartite graphs}
  \begin{definition}[Bipartite graphs] A graph $G$ is \emph{bipartite} if we can colour every vertex either blue or red so that every edge goes between a blue vertex and a red vertex.
  \end{definition}
  \begin{definition}[Complete bipartite graphs] The \emph{complete bipartite graph} $K_{m,n}$ consists of $m+n$ vertices, $m$ coloured red, $n$ coloured blue, and an edge between any red vertex and and any blue vertex.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{block}{Examples}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Another way to characterise bipartite graphs}  
  \begin{lemma}A graph $G$ is bipartite if and only if it doesn't have any cycles of odd length (i.e., subgraphs of the form $C_{2k+1}$).
    
    \end{lemma}
  \begin{block}{Bipartite $\implies$ no odd cycles:}
    Subgraphs of bipartite graphs are bipartite
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{No odd cycles $\implies$ Bipartite:}
Try to colour $G$ by distance from $v$   
\end{block}
  \begin{definition}[Distance]Let $G$ be connected, and let $v,w$ be two vertices.  The \emph{distance from $v$ to $w$} is the least number of edges in any walk from $v$ to $w$.
    \end{definition}

\begin{frame}{$\lfloor 13/2\rfloor$ ways of looking a tree (After Wallace Stevens)}
  \begin{block}{Proposition:} Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices.  The following are equivalent.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $G$ is a tree (i.e., $G$ connected but has no cycles)
    \item There is a unique path in $G$ between any two vertices
    \item $G$ is connected and has $n-1$ edges
    \item $G$ has no cycles and has $n-1$ edges
    \item $G$ is connected, but removing any edge disconnects $G$
    \item $G$ has no cycles, but adding any edge creates a cycle
      \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Informally: Trees are Goldilocks graphs}
    \begin{itemize}
\item    Trees have enough edges: they're connected \\
\item    Trees don't have too many edges: they have no cycles
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Make like a tree and get out of here (After Biff Tannen)}

  \begin{definition}[Tree]Let $T$ be a tree.  A vertex $v\in T$ is a \emph{leaf} if it has degree 1.\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}Let $T$ be a tree with $2\leq n<\infty$ vertices.  Then $T$ has at least two leaves. \end{lemma}

\begin{block}{Proof 1: See title of slide.}
Pick an edge, and try to ``leave'' -- that is, walk as far as you can.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No loops, so you'll never return to where you are
  \item Finitely many vertices, so it can't go on forever
  \end{itemize}
Eventually you'll get stuck -- that's a leaf.
\end{block}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Pruning Trees}
  \begin{block}{Part of Proposition:} If $T$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, then $T$ has $n-1$ edges.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Proof: Induct on $n$}
    \begin{itemize} \item Base case: $n=1$
      \item Now assume that all trees with $n-1$ vertices have $n-2$ edges
      \item If $T$ is a tree with $n$ vertices, it has a leaf $v$ (by Lemma)
        \item Delete $v$ and the edge next to it to get a new tree $T^\prime$ 
        \item $T^\prime$ has $n-1$ vertices, so $n-2$ edges, so $T$ has $n-1$ edges.
          \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Another use of the handshaking lemma}
  \begin{block}{Part of Proposition:}
    If $G$ is a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges, then $G$ is a tree.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Proof: induct on $n$}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Base case: $n=1$
    \item Assume proposition is true for all graphs with $n-1$ vertices
    \item Since $G$ is connected, it has no vertices of degree 0
    \item Use handshaking to show $G$ must have a vertex $v$ of degree 1
    \item Delete $v$ and the edge next to it to get a new graph $G^\prime$
    \item $G^\prime$ is a tree, so $G$ must have been as well
